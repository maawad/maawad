I'm Muhammad Awad (pronouns: he/him/his). I recieved my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, Davis, and I was advised by **Professor John Owens**. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt, in 2013.

### 🔬 Research.

My research focuses on building GPU data structures. Here are some data structures that I designed and built:
- [🌳 Dynamic GPU B-Tree](https://github.com/owensgroup/GpuBTree)
- [⌛ Multiversion GPU B-Tree](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree)
- [🕸 Dynamic hash-based GPU graph data structure (integrated into Gunrock)](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/dynamic-graph)
- [🧹 GPU (on-device) epoch-based memory reclamation scheme to safely reclaim memory
for concurrent GPU data structures](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree)
- [#️⃣ Static GPU hash tables that use probing schemes including cuckoo hashing, power-of-two choices, and iceberg hashing](https://github.com/owensgroup/BGHT)
- [👨‍💻 Bucketed Cuckoo hash set written in PTX and JIT-compiled.](https://github.com/maawad/PTX_BCHT)
