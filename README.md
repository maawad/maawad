I'm Muhammad Awad (pronouns: he/him/his), a **Ph.D. candidate** in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California, Davis, advised by **Professor John Owens**. I received my bachelor's degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt, in 2013.

**I'm graduating next June 2022, and I'm looking for full-time career opportunities.**

### 🔬 Research.

My research focuses on building GPU data structures. Here are some data structures that I designed and built:
- [🌳 Dynamic GPU B-Tree](https://github.com/owensgroup/GpuBTree)
- [⌛ Multiversion GPU B-Tree](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree)
- [🕸 Dynamic hash-based GPU graph data structure (integrated into Gunrock)](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/dynamic-graph)
- [🧹 GPU (on-device) epoch-based memory reclamation scheme to safely reclaim memory
for concurrent GPU data structures](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree)
- [#️⃣ Static GPU hash tables that use probing schemes including cuckoo hashing, power-of-two choices, and iceberg hashing](https://github.com/owensgroup/BGHT)
- [👨‍💻 Bucketed Cuckoo hash set written in PTX and JIT-compiled.](https://github.com/maawad/PTX_BCHT)
### 💻 Programming.

FORTRAN 77 was the first programming language that I mastered back in 2010, and it is when I fell in love with programming! During my undergrad graduation and class projects, I used programming to automate different ship design steps. I write code to automate other daily life tasks as well!

I love writing, debugging, and optimizing code. After I write some functions, my favorite next steps are stepping through the code line by line in debug sessions, inspecting assembly, and counting memory instructions! 

As much as I love high-level programming languages, I also enjoy writing code at the lowest level possible. I wrote an entire [GPU hash table implementation in PTX](https://github.com/maawad/PTX_BCHT).

### ⚡ Fun fact.

Writing papers rebuttals is my favorite part about grad school.
