### 👋 Hi there — I’m Muhammad Awad

I'm a **Senior Member of Technical Staff** at **AMD Research**, working on various problems including **heterogeneous computing**, **AI for performance engineering**, and **libraries for distributed and heterogeneous systems**.

Before joining AMD, I completed my **Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **UC Davis**, advised by [John Owens](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/). My research there focused on building **dynamic concurrent data structures on GPUs**, such as B-trees, dynamic graphs, multiversioned trees, and high-performance hash tables.

### 💼 Current Focus @ AMD

At AMD, I lead and contribute to projects spanning:

- **AI-powered tools for GPU performance and productivity**
- **Libraries and runtimes for heterogeneous and distributed systems**
- **Programming models for AMD GPUs and Ryzen™ AI NPUs**

Notable projects:

- 🔁 [**Iris**](https://github.com/ROCm/iris): Triton-based multi-GPU programming framework with SHMEM-like RMA APIs — combining programmability and performance in just a few hundred lines of Python and Triton.
- 🧠 [**IntelliPerf**](https://github.com/AMDResearch/intelliperf): LLM-powered GPU performance engineering pipeline that profiles, diagnoses, rewrites, and validates GPU kernels automatically.
- ⚙️ [**IRON**](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie): Contributor to IRON, a low-level development stack for AMD Ryzen™ AI NPUs. IRON exposes Python APIs, MLIR compiler passes, and abstractions that enhance the programmability and expressivity of NPUs for developers.

### 🔬 Academic Research

I’m broadly interested in **parallel computing**, **concurrent data structures**, **performance analysis**, and **low-level GPU programming**. As a Ph.D. student, I designed and built several GPU-native data structures:

- 🌳 [**Dynamic GPU B-Tree**](https://github.com/owensgroup/GpuBTree)
- ⌛ [**Multiversion GPU B-Tree**](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree)
- 🕸 [**Dynamic graph data structure**](https://github.com/gunrock/gunrock/tree/dynamic-graph) (integrated into Gunrock)
- 🧹 [**Epoch-based memory reclamation**](https://github.com/owensgroup/MVGpuBTree) for safe memory reuse on GPUs
- #️⃣ [**Static GPU hash tables**](https://github.com/owensgroup/BGHT) — including cuckoo, Po2, and iceberg hashing
- 👨‍💻 [**PTX-level bucketed cuckoo hash set**](https://github.com/maawad/PTX_BCHT) — written in PTX and JIT-compiled
